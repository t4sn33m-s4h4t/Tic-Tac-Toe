<h1>LTic Tac Toe Game using Magic Square</h1>
This is a Tic Tac Toe game built with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. What makes this implementation unique is that it uses a mathematical formula called Magic Square to determine the best move for the computer player.

<h2>Magic Square</h2>
A magic square is a square grid of numbers where the sum of each row, column, and diagonal is the same. In this Tic Tac Toe game, the Magic Square is used to determine the best move for the computer player.

The Magic Square used in this game looks like this:

8 3 4 <br/>
1 5 9<br/>
6 7 2<br/>



<h2>How to Play</h2>
To play the game, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. The game board will appear, and you can start playing by clicking on any empty spot on the board.

The game will automatically switch between the human player and the computer player. The computer will make its move using the Magic Square algorithm.

The game will end when either the human player or the computer player has three marks in a row, column, or diagonal, or when there are no more empty spots on the board.
